            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Writing is a madness - I couldn't stop if I tried. (Bukowski)</h1><p>Basically I like to think of satire as the most potent weapon in a writers proverbial arsenal when it comes to getting a point across. Satire is a way for those without power to laugh at those with power, or a way to belittle something which scares you. Or launch a scathing attack on something which angers you.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f7fee2af-c5b2-444f-a7c3-fcee59b46ff5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Callum O'Donnell - Author Focus & Interview - Writer's Edit</h1><p>Callum O'Donnell's first book, The Sturgeon General Recommends Callum O'Donnell, certainly fits the SG's criterion of writing that is "too strange, too upsettingly odd, and most of all, too funny to live anywhere else."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/38316e15151371fe56f576d3cb6c24b951d1929c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Sturgeon General Recommends</h1><p>Callum writes clever, cynical fiction in the style of Martin Amis and Bret Easton Ellis. He also writes poetry. He also works in a shipyard at the moment, building ships. I find that incredibly interesting, but he’s pretty blase about it.  He was shortlisted for last years Monash Undergraduate Prize for Creative Writing. For The Sturgeon General, he has written two stories ‘Plant Life’ and ‘The Plight of the Barraya Swamp Hen’. ‘Plant Life’ is perhaps the most in-depth exploration of using photosynthesis to get ahead in business that I’ve ever read.
