**The Sturgeon General is an anthology of comedic writing, compiling short works of fiction and non-fiction and other miscellany for the hilarious good of all. Each issue features the work of a single comedy writer.**

You can buy it for the bargain price of $1 here [http://momentumbooks.com.au/books/sturgeon-general-recommends-callum-odonnell/][0]

Callum O'Donnell writes smart, cynical stories that reflect the sorry state of the world. It includes the story of a man who imitates plants to get ahead in the workplace, and a tale of eco-terrorism and fear mongering journalism in a small Australian town.
