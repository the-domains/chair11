description: "Callum writes clever, cynical fiction in the style of Martin Amis and Bret Easton Ellis. He also writes poetry. He also works in a shipyard at the moment, building ships. I find that incredibly interesting, but he’s pretty blase about it. \_He was shortlisted for last years Monash Undergraduate Prize for Creative Writing. For The Sturgeon General, he has written two stories ‘Plant Life’ and ‘The Plight of the Barraya Swamp Hen’. ‘Plant Life’ is perhaps the most in-depth exploration of using photosynthesis to get ahead in business that I’ve ever read.

Callum writes clever, cynical fiction in the style of Martin Amis and Bret Easton Ellis. He also writes poetry. He also works in a shipyard at the moment, building ships. I find that incredibly interesting, but he's pretty blase about it.  He was shortlisted for last years Monash Undergraduate Prize for Creative Writing. For The Sturgeon General, he has written two stories 'Plant Life' and 'The Plight of the Barraya Swamp Hen'. 'Plant Life' is perhaps the most in-depth exploration of using photosynthesis to get ahead in business that I've ever read. (Patrick Lenton - Editor)

> "Homeless Eddie emerges from the bathroom, scrubbing at his wet hair with hand towels. He washes himself in there. We watch as he retrieves a comb from the plastic bag he keeps tied around his midriff, kicking a pile of old newspaper and cardboard under his desk. Ted looks on in admiration. 'Man, first here again! I'll never beat that guy.'
